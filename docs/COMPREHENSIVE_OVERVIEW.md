# Comprehensive Overview

AnamorphX is an experimental neural programming language accompanied by an integrated machine learning IDE. The project aims to simplify the creation and analysis of neural networks through a custom language and real‑time tooling.

## Key Features
- **Neural Programming Language** with more than 80 commands
- **Automatic PyTorch Generation** from `network` blocks
- **Real‑time IDE** with syntax highlighting, auto completion and debugging
- **Visualization Tools** for inspecting network graphs and execution
- **Security Focus** for running untrusted code safely

## Architecture
1. **Lexer and Parser** convert source files into an abstract syntax tree
2. **Interpreter** executes the AST and provides runtime services
3. **Neural Backend** translates networks to PyTorch and runs training
4. **IDE** ties everything together with live analysis and visual editing

## Project Status
The core language and IDE are functional. Work continues on advanced features such as the visual designer and extended command set. Overall progress is about 60% complete.
