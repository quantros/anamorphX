# AnamorphX Project Roadmap

This roadmap consolidates the goals from `docs/RoadMap.md`, `docs/specs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` and `docs/TT.md`.
It outlines the major development phases of the AnamorphX language and IDE.

## Phase 1 – Language Foundations
- Finalize the language concept and vocabulary (80+ commands)
- Define the full grammar in EBNF
- Design compiler and interpreter architecture

## Phase 2 – Parser Implementation
- Build the lexer and parser with extensive unit tests
- Generate an abstract syntax tree (AST)

## Phase 3 – Interpreter Core
- Execute programs from the AST
- Implement all core commands with built‑in security
- Provide a sandboxed runtime

## Phase 4 – Visual IDE
- Develop a graphical editor that displays the program as a neural network
- Support live editing and visualization of signals

## Phase 5 – Testing and Debugging
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Load testing for secure web requests
- Cross‑platform verification

## Phase 6 – Documentation and Tutorials
- Full language reference and developer guides
- Example projects and walkthroughs

## Phase 7 – Public Release
- Package the interpreter and IDE
- Publish the initial open source release
- Plan future enhancements

The project is currently around **60% complete** with the neural backend and IDE functional.
